/**
 * End-to-end tests for {@link HttpsRelayProtocolModule}.
 *
 * <p>This protocol defines a connection in which the proxy behaves as a standard http client (sans
 * the relay operation which is excluded in end-to-end testing). Because non user-defined handlers
 * are used, the tests here focus on verifying that the request written to the network socket by the
 * client is reconstructed faithfully by a server, and vice versa, that the response the client
 * decoded from incoming bytes is equivalent to the response sent by the server.
 *
 * <p>These tests only ensure that the client represented by this protocol is compatible with a
 * server implementation provided by Netty itself. They test the self-consistency of various Netty
 * handlers that deal with HTTP protocol, but not whether the handlers converts between bytes and
 * HTTP messages correctly, which is presumed correct.
